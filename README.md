# Matrix Profile Paper

The Matrix Profile has the potential to revolutionize time series data mining because of its generality, versatility,
simplicity and scalability. In particular it has implications for time series motif discovery, time series joins,
shapelet discovery (classification), density estimation, semantic segmentation, visualization, rule discovery,
clustering etc.

  abstract = {Recently, the spread of IoT technologies has led to an unprecedented acquisition of energy-related data providing accessible knowledge on the actual performance of buildings during their operation. A proper analysis of such data supports energy and facility managers in spotting valuable energy saving opportunities. In this context, anomaly detection and diagnosis (ADD) tools allow a prompt and automatic recognition of abnormal and non-optimal energy performance patterns enabling a better decision-making to reduce energy wastes and system inefficiencies. To this aim, this paper introduces a novel meter-level ADD process capable to identify energy consumption anomalies at meter-level and perform diagnosis by exploiting information at sub-load level. The process leverages supervised and unsupervised analytics techniques coupled with the distance-based contextual matrix profile (CMP) algorithm to discover infrequent subsequences in energy consumption timeseries considering specific boundary conditions. The proposed process has self-tuning capabilities and can rank anomalies at both meter and sub-load level by means of robust severity score. The methodology is tested on one-year energy consumption timeseries of a medium/low voltage transformation cabin of the university campus of Politecnico di Torino leading to the detection of 55 anomalous subsequences that are diagnosed by analysing a group of 8 different sub-loads.}
