considers both the absolute and relative energy consumption differences between the sub-load’s profile corresponding to the detected anomalous day and the centroid of the relative cluster. The absolute difference ϵ_abs represents the energy consumption surplus or deficit of a specific day and context in relation to the amount typically required by all days belonging to the cluster. On the other hand, the relative difference ϵ_rel represents the same quantity but in terms of percentage. For instance, if an anomalous subsequence in a given context requires 100 kWh and the average energy consumption of days belonging to that cluster and context is 80 kWh, the absolute difference is 20 kWh and the relative difference is 25%. Both approaches are significant for the results interpretation since the first effectively identifies the responsible sub-load in terms of magnitude while the second identifies the sub-load that exhibits the unusual behaviour.
Again matrix profile on subloads and analysis on only the detected days.
